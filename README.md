## U-Net drive scene segmentation 

######  Project for Szenergy

The purpose of this project is to provide a neural network capable of semantic segmentation for the Szenergy Team. This network will act as a groundwork for further deep learning solutions (e.g. using it for transfer learning )implemented in the autonomous vehicle of the team. It is a U-Net implementation from scratch using tf.keras, which will be trained on our custom relabeled cityscapes dataset.

Training results after 150 epochs, custom re-labeled cityscapes dataset, with 5 classes:
